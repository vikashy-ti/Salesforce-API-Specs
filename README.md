# Salesforce-API-Specs
This repo contains API specifications for Salesforce API obtained from their official Postman Collection.

- The postman collections were exported from here: [Salesforce Developers Postman Collections](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers/)
- Then openAPI specs were generated using this tool: [postman2openapi](https://github.com/kevinswiber/postman2openapi)
